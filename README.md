# Surfs_up
## Overview

The purpose of this project is to receive more information about temperature trends before opening the surf shop. Specifically, temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

## Results

Here are three key differences in weather between June and December:

**1.** The mean temperature is about 4 degrees higher in June than December

**2.** The minimum temperate in December is 12 degrees lower than the minimum temperature in June

**3.** Even though the minimum temperatures have a 12 degree difference, the maximum temperature in June is only 2 degrees more than the maximum temperature in December


## Summary

After analyzing my results, I have concluded that W. Avy should open a surf and ice cream shop business because it is sustainable year-round. We can see that the mean in both months are pretty close to each other and December's macimum temperature is nearly the same as June's. In the two additional queries I have created below, you can see that it does rain more in December, but most of the rainfall remains below 3 inches. In both months, you can see that as the temperature increases, the precipitation decreases.
